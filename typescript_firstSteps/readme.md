# typescript



## Getting Started

This quide shows what has to offer typescript as well as differences between ts and js.
I divided typescript int o five scrions :
- types
- interfaces
- classes
- imports
- generics
If something needed to be described then it is desribed in comments.

### Prerequisites

You need to have some basic knowledge about js and object-oriented programming :)

## Running application

  You need to have typescript compiler on your computer, then you can use some IDE (like webstorm)
  or compile *.ts files manually (tsc {name_of_the_file}.ts) (it will spit out {name_of_the_file}.js
  file which is executable in browser/nodejs).
