# mongoose



## Getting Started

This is simple terminal application which shows some basic possibilities
offered by mongoose ORM.  
In "mongodb" folder you can see how to use mongoose schemas (userSchema.js)
and models(userModel.js), as well as see how to connect to your mongodb
database (connection.js).  
In app.js comments and logs will walk you through procces of creating new model,
saving model to database, quering db, updating and removing items.    
### Prerequisites

You need node.js and npm to run this application.  
You also need running mongodb server on your computer
(eventually you can connect to your hosted mongodb server).
(If there is a problem with connection with database,
check mongodb/connection.js file and check if port number
is the same as in this file)

## Running application

  command to start application :
#### node app.js
